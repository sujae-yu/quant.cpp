## Current Status

### What Works
- ✅ Self-contained inference engine (0 dependencies, pure C)
- ✅ Multi-threaded matmul (4 threads: 31 tok/s inference, 1.56x speedup)
- ✅ Qwen3.5-0.8B: loads, tokenizes, generates correct text
- ✅ DeltaNet + Self-Attention hybrid forward pass (layer-by-layer validated)
- ✅ KV cache quantization library (8 types, integer Q4×Q8 attention)
- ✅ **KV cache quantization integrated into inference forward pass** (quantize-on-store, Q4xQ8 integer attention for seq_len > 32)
- ✅ **tok/s display** in tq_run output (timing via clock_gettime)
- ✅ **Streaming BF16**: embed_tokens + lm_head kept as mmap'd BF16, converted on demand (saves ~2GB for Qwen3.5-0.8B)
- ✅ **Q8 weight quantization**: `-q` flag converts layer weights to int8 + per-block scale (block_size=32), ~2x memory reduction with NEON-optimized Q8 matmul
- ✅ 19 C++ test suites (42 test cases in test_ops), 22 Python tests
- ✅ CLI tools: tq_run (-j threads), tq, tq_chat, tq_realtime_demo

### What Needs Work (Priority Order)
1. **Memory**: ~~3.3GB~~ ~1.3GB for BF16->FP32 conversion (embed_tokens + lm_head kept as BF16, saving ~2GB). With `-q` flag, layer weights quantized to Q8 (~0.65GB for weights, total ~0.8GB).
2. **Weight quantization**: ~~Q8/Q4 weights for 2x memory reduction~~ Q8 implemented. Q4 weights for further 2x reduction.
3. **Metal GPU inference**: Apple GPU for matmul
4. **Value cache quantization**: currently only keys are quantized in the cache

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CPU inference (4 threads) | ~31 tok/s (Qwen3.5-0.8B, excl. loading) |
| CPU inference (1 thread) | 12.8 tok/s |
| PyTorch CPU | 0.8 tok/s (16-39x slower) |
| PyTorch MPS | 10 tok/s (3x slower than our CPU) |
| KV compression | 7.5x (uniform_4b) |
| Integer attention | 2.9-4.8x faster than FP32 |
| Real model cosine | 0.994 (A+) |
| Q8 weight mem | ~1.125 bytes/value (vs 4 FP32) |
| Tests | 19 C++ (42 in test_ops) + 22 Python |
