# Batched Prefill — Implementation Handoff (2026-04-15)

## Status

- ✅ **Strategy**: documented in `bench/results/2026-04-15_accelerate_gemm_microbench.md`.
  Apple AMX delivers 1.2 TFLOPS via cblas_sgemm; GEMV path peaks at ~15 GFLOPS.
  100× speedup is real but requires the workload to be batched.
- ✅ **Primitive**: `tq_batched_matmul_q4()` in `src/engine/tq_ops.c`.
  Unit-tested in `tools/test_batched_matmul.c` — 12/12 PASS, max_rel=0.0000,
  observed speedups 1.2-3.0× across realistic shapes (Phi-3.5, Llama 3.x).
- ✅ **Integration scaffolding**: `tq_forward_batch()` in `src/engine/tq_transformer.c`
  + opt-in flag `TQ_BATCH_PREFILL=1` in `src/engine/tq_generate.c`.
  Compiles, runs, falls back gracefully on unsupported architectures.
- ❌ **Numerical correctness of tq_forward_batch**: end-to-end output diverges
  from baseline. Matmul primitive is bit-identical (verified at primitive
  level), so the bug is somewhere in the surrounding orchestration (state,
  RoPE, KV cache layout, residual flow, or embedding source).

Reproduce divergence:
```bash
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build TQ_BATCH_PREFILL=1 \
  build/quant models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf -p "Hello world" -n 5 -T 0
# prints: " hell hel hell h hel"

DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=build \
  build/quant models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf -p "Hello world" -n 5 -T 0
# prints: " I'm so excited"  ← baseline (correct)
```

## Debugging plan for next session

1. **Add intermediate-state dumps** to `tq_forward` and `tq_forward_batch`.
   Compare layer-0 outputs (Xres after attention residual) byte-by-byte
   for the same single token. If they differ, the bug is at layer 0
   before any batching matters.

2. **Likely suspects ranked by probability**:

   **(a) RMSNorm input vs output buffer.** My code calls
   `tq_rmsnorm(XBN+n*dim, Xres+n*dim, ...)`. tq_forward calls
   `tq_rmsnorm(s->xb, s->x, ...)`. The pattern is the same, but verify
   the eps value is exactly `c->rms_norm_eps` and the weight pointer is
   `layer->attn_norm` (not `layer->ffn_norm`).

   **(b) KV cache stride.** Forward uses `cache_kv_dim` (computed via
   sliding/full max). For Llama 3.x non-Gemma this should equal kv_dim,
   but worth printing both at write time to confirm.

   **(c) attn_output_gate.** Llama doesn't have it, but verify
   `c->attn_output_gate == 0`.

   **(d) Output deinterleave.** When attn_output_gate is set, Q is
   interleaved with a gate. We don't handle this in tq_forward_batch
   because we bail when the flag is set... but is the bail check there?
   (Currently no — should add.)

3. **RoPE freq formula.** My batched code:
   ```c
   float base = 1.0f / powf(c->rope_freq_base, 2.0f * i / (float)c->head_dim);
   float freq = base / model->rope_freqs[i];
   ```
   Compare to tq_forward line 1217-1219:
   ```c
   float base_freq = 1.0f / powf(rope_base, 2.0f * i / (float)rope_n_dims);
   float freq = base_freq / model->rope_freqs[i];
   ```
   Note: `rope_n_dims` may not equal `head_dim`! For Gemma 4 they differ.
   For Llama 3 should be same but verify `c->rope_n_dims` and use it
   instead of head_dim.

4. **The attention computation**. Mine uses the simplest causal scan over
   K/V cache positions. tq_forward uses the same but might apply scaling
   factors (logit_softcap for Gemma, attention_bias for some, etc.).
   Llama 3 should be plain — verify no scale factor is missed.

## Architectural targets

Once correctness is achieved, expected gains (per microbench):
- N=8 prefill chunk: ~3× per-matmul vs single
- N=32 prefill chunk: ~30× per-matmul vs single
- N=128 prefill chunk: ~60-100× per-matmul vs single

The `tq_batched_matmul_q4` primitive currently gives 1.5-3× because it
works over Q4 weights and dequant overhead caps the win below the AMX
ceiling. Future optimizations (in priority):

1. **Persistent FP16 lm_head** — ~1.5× decode + huge prefill win for Qwen3.5-4B
2. **BNNS quantized GEMM** — direct AMX with int8 weights, no dequant overhead
3. **MPSGraph for multi-layer fused forward** — entire layer on GPU

## Out-of-scope for this implementation

Don't try to make tq_forward_batch handle every architecture in v1. Bail
on:
- `is_gemma4`, `is_moe`, `has_fused_qkv`, `has_fused_up_gate`
- `n_kv_shared_layers > 0`
- Any layer with `delta_a_log` (DeltaNet)
- `attn_output_gate` (rare; just bail)
- `partial_rotary_factor > 0` (Phi-3 LongRoPE)

The fast path should cover Llama 1B/3B/8B Q8_0 and Q4_K_M with load-time
Q4 conversion. Other models stay on the per-token path. We can extend
case-by-case.
